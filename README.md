# Udemy Clone

## Overview

Welcome to my Udemy clone project! This project is a replication of the popular online learning platform Udemy, built entirely from scratch. It has been developed to enhance my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and responsive design, providing me with valuable front-end development skills.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.
  
- **Course Listings:** Users can browse through a variety of courses offered on the platform, with detailed information about each course including title, instructor, ratings, and price.

- **Course Details:** Clicking on a course provides users with more information such as course description, curriculum, instructor bio, and reviews.

- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for courses based on keywords, categories, or instructor names, making it easy to find courses of interest.

- **User Authentication:** While not implemented in this version, future iterations may include user authentication and account management features.
